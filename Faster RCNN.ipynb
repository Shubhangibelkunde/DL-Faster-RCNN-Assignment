The input image is fed into a CNN (like ResNet or VGG) to extract feature maps that highlight important characteristics of the image.\n","\n","Region Proposal Network (RPN):\n","\n","Role: Generates region proposals. The RPN scans the feature maps produced by the CNN and proposes regions (bounding boxes) where objects are likely to be found. It uses anchors of various sizes and aspect ratios to achieve this.\n","\n","RoI Pooling Layer:\n","\n","Role: Warps the proposed regions to a fixed size. The RoI (Region of Interest) pooling layer takes the regions proposed by the RPN and reshapes them into a uniform size, allowing them to be fed into the fully connected layers.\n","\n","Fully Connected Layers:\n","\n","Role: Classifies and refines bounding boxes. The features from the RoI pooling layer are passed through fully connected layers to predict the class of the object within each region and refine the bounding box coordinates for more accurate detection.\n","\n","Output Layers:\n","\n","Role: Produce the final object detections.
